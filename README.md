# About me

I have recently graduated in Applied Mathematics at the University of Science and Technology AGH. I am interested in cutting-edge technology, in particular in data analysis and machine learning. I have almost two years of Data Science experience in the fueling industry. Lately, I had the opportunity to be a speaker at Data Science Summit 2022. I was very active person in student life. During my studies, I worked in the AGH Medical Technology student research group where we were trying to use EMG signals to control hand prostheses. Also, I helped to organize science conferences at AGH. My biggest hobby is hiking and whitewater kayaking, I was a part of the board of ,, Klub Organizatorów I
Symatyków Turystyki ‘’Hawiarska Koliba” where I am helping to organize some trips and care about our finances. Right now I spent more time in the AKTK Bystrze club where besides swimming in the kayak I am responsible for marketing and taking care of club's social media. I consider myself a strongly committed person, eager to learn, and open to new challenges.
